        <h1>Privacy Policy for StatShark</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 19, 2024</p>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 19, 2024</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>StatShark ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our data practices for the StatShark mobile application available on the Apple App Store.</p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p><strong>StatShark does not collect any personal data from users.</strong></p>

        <p>The app operates with the following privacy principles:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>No user accounts or registration required</li>
            <li>No personal information collected</li>
            <li>No tracking across apps or websites</li>
            <li>No device identifiers collected or stored</li>
            <li>No analytics or crash reporting services</li>
            <li>No advertising identifiers (IDFA) used</li>
            <li>No cookies or similar tracking technologies</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>StatShark stores the following data locally on your device using standard iOS UserDefaults:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fantasy Team Data:</strong> Your fantasy roster selections, team name, and league information</li>
            <li><strong>App Preferences:</strong> Settings like selected teams, filters, or favorites</li>
            <li><strong>Cached Content:</strong> Temporarily cached API responses for offline viewing</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> All of this data remains exclusively on your device. It is never transmitted to our servers or any third party. This data is automatically deleted when you uninstall the app.</p>

        <h2>Network Communications</h2>
        <p>StatShark requires an internet connection to fetch publicly available NFL data. The app communicates with the following services:</p>

        <h3>Our API Server (statshark-api.azurewebsites.net)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Fetch game predictions, team data, and aggregated statistics</li>
            <li><strong>Data Sent:</strong> Only the team abbreviations and season requested (for example, "KC" for Kansas City Chiefs)</li>
            <li><strong>Data Received:</strong> Publicly available NFL data and AI-generated predictions</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> None sent or received</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Third-Party Data Sources</h3>
        <p>Our server (not your device) fetches data from:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ESPN API:</strong> Game schedules, scores, and news articles (public data)</li>
            <li><strong>API-Sports:</strong> Player statistics and headshots (public data, seasons 2022+)</li>
            <li><strong>The Odds API:</strong> Vegas betting lines (public data)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Your device does not communicate directly with these services. All requests go through our server, which does not log or store any information about app users.</p>

        <h3>News Article Links</h3>
        <p>When you tap a news article, it opens in Safari. Safari has its own privacy policy managed by Apple. StatShark does not track which articles you view.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p><strong>StatShark does not share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>No data sold to advertisers</li>
            <li>No data shared with partners</li>
            <li>No data provided to analytics companies</li>
            <li>No user profiles created or maintained</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>While StatShark does not collect personal data, we still implement security best practices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All network communications use HTTPS encryption</li>
            <li>API servers hosted on secure Azure infrastructure</li>
            <li>No user databases or stored credentials</li>
            <li>Regular security updates</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Fantasy League Data</h2>
        <p>When you create or join a fantasy league:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your roster and league information are stored only on your device</li>
            <li><strong>Invite Codes:</strong> League invite codes are generated locally and shared manually by you</li>
            <li><strong>No Server Sync:</strong> League data is not synchronized across devices or stored on our servers</li>
            <li><strong>Data Loss:</strong> If you delete the app or get a new device, your fantasy team data will be lost unless you manually back up your device</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal reasons. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date at the top.</p>
        <p>Material changes will be communicated through an app update with release notes describing the privacy changes.</p>
