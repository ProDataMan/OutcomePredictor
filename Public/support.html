        <h1>StatShark Support</h1>
        <p>Welcome to StatShark support. Find answers to common questions and learn how to get the most out of the app.</p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p><strong>Q: Do I need to create an account?</strong><br>
        No! StatShark works immediately after download. No registration, no login, no personal information required.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How do I view team information?</strong><br>
        Open the app and tap the "Teams" tab. Select any of the 32 NFL teams to view their roster, schedule, and latest news.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How do predictions work?</strong><br>
        Tap the "Predict" tab to see AI-powered predictions for upcoming games. Each prediction includes a confidence score and reasoning. You can also create custom predictions by tapping "Predict a Game" and selecting any two teams.</p>

        <h2>Fantasy Football</h2>
        <p><strong>Q: How do I build a fantasy team?</strong><br>
        Tap the "Fantasy" tab, then "Team Search". Select a team to browse players, or select a position filter (QB, RB, WR, TE, K, DEF) to see top players across all teams. Tap any player to add them to your roster.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: What are the roster limits?</strong><br>
        - Quarterbacks (QB): 2 max<br>
        - Running Backs (RB): 3 max<br>
        - Wide Receivers (WR): 3 max<br>
        - Tight Ends (TE): 2 max<br>
        - Kickers (K): 1 max<br>
        - Defense (DEF): 1 max</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How do I change my team name?</strong><br>
        In the Fantasy tab, tap the gear icon (⚙️) in the top left to access settings. From there you can edit your team name and league names.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: How do fantasy leagues work?</strong><br>
        Create a league, share the invite code with friends, and they can join using that code. All league members can view each other's rosters and compete for the best fantasy team.</p>

        <h2>Game Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Q: How do I see live scores?</strong><br>
        Live games appear in the "Predict" tab and on team detail pages. Games in progress show a red "LIVE" indicator with current score, quarter, and time remaining.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can I view past games?</strong><br>
        Yes! On any team's detail page, use the season selector to view games from 2020-2025. Historical matchup data is also shown on game detail pages.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Where do the player stats come from?</strong><br>
        Player statistics come from API-Sports and are real season data (not sample data). Stats are available from the 2022 season onwards.</p>

        <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p><strong>Q: The app shows "Error Loading Data"</strong><br>
        Make sure you have an internet connection. StatShark requires network access to fetch live NFL data. Try tapping the refresh button or pulling down to refresh the content.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Player photos are not loading</strong><br>
        Player headshots are loaded from external sources and may take a moment to appear. If photos don't load, check your internet connection.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Predictions are not available</strong><br>
        Predictions require an active internet connection to our API server. If predictions are unavailable, the server may be updating or experiencing high traffic. Try again in a few minutes.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: News articles won't open</strong><br>
        News articles open in Safari. Make sure Safari is not restricted in your device settings (Settings → Screen Time → Content & Privacy Restrictions).</p>

        <h2>Data & Privacy</h2>
        <p><strong>Q: What data does StatShark collect?</strong><br>
        None! StatShark does not collect any personal data. Your fantasy team and preferences are stored locally on your device only. See our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Can I use the app offline?</strong><br>
        Previously viewed content may be available offline, but StatShark requires an internet connection to fetch live scores, predictions, and updated data.</p>
